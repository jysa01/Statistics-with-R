# Read in the data file from gender.Rdata, sem.Rdata or relclause.Rdata.
# You can choose the one you'd like best based on the description of the items below, 
# and explore the analysis for that dataset. Afterwards, you can adapt your analysis 
# for the other datasets (that should be considerably less work.)

# The files contain data from an experiment where people were reading sentences, 
# and pressed the space bar to see the next word. The duration for which a word was 
# viewed before pressing the space bar again is the reading time of the word, and is 
# stored in the file as "WORD_TIME". The experiment had 24 items (given as "ITEM_ID") 
# and 24 subjects (given as "PARTICIPANT"). The order in which the different sentences 
# were presented in the experiment is given in the variable "itemOrder". 

# For each of the files, the sentences that were shown had a different property. 

# Sentences in the sem.Rdata experiment had a semantic violation, i.e. a word that 
# didn't fit in with the previous words in terms of its meaning. The experiment 
# contained two versions of each item, which were identical to one another except 
# for the one sentence containing a semantic violation, while the other one was 
# semantically correct. These conditions are named "SG" for "semantically good" 
# and "SB" for "semantically bad".

# Semantic materials (the experiment is in German, English translation given 
# for those who don't speak German')

# Christina schie√üt / raucht eine Zigarette nach der Arbeit. 
# "Christina is shooting / smoking a cigarette after work."

# The crticial word here is "Zigarette", as this would be very surprising in the 
# context of the verb "schie√üt", but not in the context of the verb "smoke". 
# Reading times are comparable because the critical word "Zigarette" is identical 
# in both conditions.

# Syntactic items:
# Simone hatte eine(n) schreckliche(n) Traum und keine Lust zum Weiterschlafen. 
# "Simone had a[masc/fem] horrible[masc/fem] dreammasc and didn't feel like sleeping 
# any longer."

# Here, there are again two conditions, one using correct grammatical gender on 
# "einen schrecklichen" vs. the other one using incorrect grammatical gender 
# "eine schreckliche". The critical word is "Traum" (it's either consisten or 
# inconsistent with the marking on the determiner and adjective)

# Relative clause items:
# Die Nachbarin, [die_sg nom/acc einige_pl nom/acc der Mieter auf Schadensersatz  
# verklagt hat_sg/ haben_pl]RC, traf sich gestern mit Angelika. 
# "The neighbor, [whom some of the tenants sued for damages / who sued some of  the
# tenants for damages]RC, met Angelika yesterday."

# When reading such a sentence, people will usually interpret the relative pronoun 
# die as the subject of the relative clause and the following noun phrase 
# "einige der Mieter" as the object. This interpretation is compatible with 
# the embedded singular-marked (sg) verb hat at the end of the relative clause. 
# Encountering the verb haben, which has plural marking (pl), leads to processing 
# difficulty: in order to make sense of the relative clause, readers need to 
# reinterpret the relative pronoun die as the object of the relative clause 
# and the following noun phrase "einige der Mieter" as its subject. 
# (Note that the sentences are all grammatical, as the relative pronoun and 
# following NPs are chosen such that they are ambiguous between nominative (nom)
# and accusative (acc) case marking.)

# The number of the word in a sentence is given in column "SEMWDINDEX". 
# 0 designates the word where the semantic violation happens (in the SB condition; 
# in the SG condition, it's the corresponding word). We call this word the 
# "critical word" or "critical region". -1 is the word before that, -2 is 
# two words before that word, and 2 is two words after that critical word. 
# "EXPWORD" shows the words. We expect longer reading times for the violation 
# at word 0 or the word after that (word 1) (if people press the button quickly 
# before thinking properly).

# distribution.

ggplot(data=genderData, aes(x=WORD_TIME, fill=ITEM_TYPE, col=ITEM_TYPE)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=0.2)
# same observation can be made for item type as well. Distribution is positively skewed. The distribution
# for GG item type has a longer tail which may be due to outliers. Lets check the boxplot.

ggplot(data=genderData, aes(y=WORD_TIME, x=ITEM_TYPE, col=ITEM_TYPE)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.2, show.legend=F)
# Looks like the participants take same time for responding to corrcect and wrong gender 
# in sentences (mean and width of boxplot is same). The extreme points are more in 
# correct gender (GG) type as concluded by darker colored points between 2000 - 4000 word time.
# The points above 5000 word time may be outliers (We can check this by plotting word time 
# of other participants for this word and later by checking the Cook's distance.)

# for that word is less than 2000 ms. 
# For the 2nd participant, we cannot say surely whether
# word time of 5036 is too long, since, from the boxplot it can be seen that while 50% of the

# as we move away from the critical word, i.e., for plots with RELWDINDEX from 1 to 7.
# in these plots however the blue and red plots greatly overlap across all RELWDINDEX
# except maybe at RELWDINDEX of 7 where GB item type seems to have a bimodal type distribution.
# We can loosely conclude that word time of participants do not change much after reading
# the GB sentence critical word until quite later into the sentence where the word may depend

# but, something else?




#    Below you also find the plot for the dataset 'sleepstudy' from the package 'lme4'.

#    time for each participant (subject) separately.

#    Your task is also to figure out how to adapt this plot for our data. What do you 
#    conclude regarding the reading sentences experiment?
# we have 24 participants in this study. We need to check whether any conclusions made about the 
# effect of a predictor variable say, ITEM_TYPE, RELWDINDEX, etc., on the response variable WORD_TIME
# is generalizable across participants, i.e., the effects (slopes and intercept) when studied in 
# each participant do not differ greatly.

print(xyplot(WORD_TIME ~  as.numeric(ITEM_ID)| PARTICIPANT, genderData, aspect = "fill",

             xlab = "Item ID",
             ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)"))
# The plot of each participant on item id shows item_id has little or no correlation to word time.
# scatter plot is horizontally spread and the regression line is more or less horizontal.
# The participant 'p24m26' is vey fast(variance along y axis is very low). For participant 'p0620mr'
# the data point on the top right corner seems a very high leverage point because this point may
# induce a negative correlation in the data which otherwise seems uncorrelated to item_id predictor.
# The intercept value of different partici[ants is different. The intercept value is more toward 0
# for the participants in the last row when compared to those in the first row.
# Also the variance along the y axis (predictor variable) is less for some participants and more 
# for others. Thus using this predictor generally for all participants may not be a good idea.

             xlab = "Type of item (SB/SG)",
             ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)"))
# the predictor item_type has a very weak to almost no positive correltaion to the response.
# The intercept value is also similar across participants.
# Thus, this predictor is generalizable over participants.

             xlab = "Exp Words",
             ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)"))
# This predictor is also generalizable across participants. The intercept across particiapnts is 
# different across participants though. The slower particiapnts (1st row with high intercept value)
# are in general slow with all words. The faster responding participants (last row, low intercept) 
# are generally faster and slower on some words (more scatter/variance in the y axis).

print(xyplot(WORD_TIME ~  itemOrder| PARTICIPANT, genderData, aspect = "fill",
             layout = c(6,4), type = c("g", "p", "r"),
             index.cond = function(x,y) coef(lm(y ~ x))[1],
             xlab = "item order",
             ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)"))
# There seems to be a consistent but very weak negative correlation between the predictor and response
# variables,  For fast responding participants (last row), the correlation is almost absent.

             xlab = "Relative word index",
             ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)"))
# For participant 'p2220fr' the word time for words at 4th position after the critical word
# is generally higher than the preceding words. Other than this the relation is consistently
# weak across all particiapnts. Here again the fastest responders are generaaly fast on all 
# word positions(small intercepts, last row).

## In general it can be said that the relation between predictors and response variables
# is more evident in the slow responders than the fast responders. For the fast responders,
